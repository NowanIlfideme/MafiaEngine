# Mafia Engine
Engine for Mafia-like games. Unsurprising, right?
This project is currently under construction.

## Planned features
### Near-term:
- General definition of a mafia game (via config)
- Runnable GM tool with command-line UI
- Example ("vanilla"/"mountainous") mafia game
- State saving, with full history
### Long-term:
- Workable API
- Interaction with various mafia forums:
	- Automatic thread parsing
	- Helper for modding/GM-ing (player statistics, vote counts, etc.)
	- Searchable history, i.e. for machine learning tasks
